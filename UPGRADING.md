# Upgrade Guide

This guide describes how to upgrade this application.

## From 2.x to 3.x (Laravel Nova 4.x)

While a lot has changed front-end wise, we've minimised the impact on your
back-end settings.

The version constraints for PHP and Laravel have updated however, please see
the README for an up-to-date versioning table.

## From 1.x to 2.x

*No significant changes written down.*

## From 0.4 to 1.x

If upgrading from v0.4.0, re-publish the config file!
